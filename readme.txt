= How do I embed visual stories from flipagram? =

With this plugin you can use the URL to embed visual stories. Just paste the item URL into your post editor:
`https://flipagram.com/f/S6i4Ox4xZo`

= How do I set custom dimensions to my visual stories? =

Since wordpress 4.2, you can double click the embedded item to set max width and max height. It will add the WordPress `[embed]` shortcode:
`[embed width="500" height="500"]https://flipagram.com/f/S6i4Ox4xZo[/embed]`

**Note:** Doing it the WordPress way, using the `[embed]` shortcode, is backwards and forward compatible, and it works with all the themes.
